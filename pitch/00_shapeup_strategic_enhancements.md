# Pitch: Configuration Management Tool Enhancement - viki

## Expiration
- Alternative solution adopted or user adoption <10 after 6 months

## Motivation

**Problem**: 80% of user time spent debugging config errors; 60% of support tickets are validation issues.

**Goal**: Add basic validation and error recovery to reduce support burden and improve adoption.

## Appetite

**Total: 12 cups of coffee**

- **3 cups shaping**: Problem validation and solution design
- **8 cups building**: Basic validation, error reporting, file backup/restore
- **1 cup cool-down**: Bug fixes and documentation

## Solution

**Key Components**:

1. **Basic Validation**: YAML syntax checking with line number error reporting
2. **File Backup**: Automatic backup before apply operations
3. **Simple Commands**: `viki validate` and `viki restore` commands

**Workflow**:
```bash
viki validate    # Check YAML syntax and basic structure
viki plan        # Show changes (existing command)
viki apply       # Execute with automatic backup
viki restore     # Restore from backup if needed
```

## Circuit Breakers

**Primary Risk**: Over-engineering simple validation
**Circuit Breaker**: Stick to basic YAML syntax checking only - no complex rules
**Time Box**: 2 cups maximum for validation implementation

**Secondary Risk**: Complex rollback system
**Circuit Breaker**: File backup/restore only - no system state rollback
**Time Box**: 2 cups maximum for backup functionality

## Out of Scope

- Multi-server operations
- System state rollback (packages, services)
- Complex validation rules beyond YAML syntax
- Interactive configuration builders
- Real-time validation during editing

## Implementation Plan

**Week 1-2**: YAML validation with error line numbers
**Week 3-4**: Automatic file backup before apply operations
**Week 5-6**: Simple restore command and testing

**Risk Indicator**: If basic YAML validation takes >2 cups, scope down further

## Success Criteria

**Must Have**:
1. `viki validate` catches YAML syntax errors with line numbers
2. Automatic config backup before apply operations
3. `viki restore` command works reliably

**Success Metric**: 50% reduction in configuration-related support tickets

## Technical Risks

**Main Risk**: Backup/restore mechanism interfering with existing state files
**Mitigation**: Use separate .backup directory, don't modify existing state.vk.json format

**Secondary Risk**: YAML validation not catching enough real errors
**Mitigation**: Start with syntax-only validation, add basic structure checks if needed

## Betting Considerations

**For**: Low-risk solution addressing top user complaint
**Against**: Might not solve fundamental usability issues

**Resources**: Single developer, 6 weeks total

## Cool-Down

- Monitor support ticket reduction
- Collect feedback on validation effectiveness
- Document lessons learned
